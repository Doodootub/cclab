                NumbyNooby is a small, cartoon-like creature with a big head and even bigger, flexible eyes that seem to follow you everywhere. He doesn’t handle the sticky Shanghai humidity very well and looks a bit dull when you leave him alone, but he instantly perks up whenever you interact with him. Despite his simple feelings and his complete inability to do math, he’s endlessly adorable. Remarkably, NumbyNooby can go a full week—or even longer—without eating, making him both sweet and surprisingly tough.
